Coach.me Research
=============

Data and analysis projects from [@coachdotme](https://coach.me).

We collect data on human potential through our goal tracking app and occassionally through additional survey work.

This is a repository for raw data and code for analysis. 

# Licenses

Our intention is to release this data so that other people can use it. The default licenses are MIT for code and Creative Commons for data. If you want to use our data:

* Please give attribution. A direct link to the Lift website is preferred: http://coach.me
* Let us know what you're working on. We'll help you promote it.

# Privacy and Data

All of our data was collected on an agreement with our users that it would be anonymized or aggregated. We've taken care to remove direct links to identity such as email, chronological data such as ordering of results and timestamps, identifying data points that can be tracked back to Lift profiles and truly sensitive answers (given that anonymization of user data is very error prone).
